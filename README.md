### üí≥ Payment Process Workflow
The application includes a comprehensive payment processing workflow that demonstrates AI agent orchestration in a real-world enterprise scenario:

#### Workflow Overview
The payment process workflow showcases how multiple AI agents work together to handle high-value payment processing with built-in anomaly detection and governance controls.

#### Key Components
1. **Payment Instruction Entry**: Natural language payment instruction parsing with intent extraction
2. **Intent Verification**: AI-powered anomaly detection and risk assessment
3. **Scenario Summary**: Comprehensive review of payment details and risk factors
4. **Payment Escalation**: Automated escalation handling with human oversight
5. **Payment Audit**: Compliance monitoring and audit trail generation

#### Process Flow Steps
1. **Input Processing**: Parse natural language payment instructions (e.g., "Send $2M CAD to Vendor X by Friday")
2. **Intent Extraction**: Extract structured data including amount, beneficiary, date, and urgency
3. **Risk Assessment**: AI agents analyze payment for anomalies and compliance issues
4. **Approval Workflow**: Multi-level approval process with automated and human checkpoints
5. **Execution**: Secure payment processing with real-time monitoring
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation and compliance reporting

#### AI Agents Involved
- **Payment Parser Agent**: Extracts structured data from natural language
- **Risk Assessment Agent**: Analyzes payment for anomalies and compliance
- **Approval Orchestrator**: Manages multi-level approval workflow
- **Compliance Monitor**: Ensures regulatory compliance (GDPR, OSFI, FINTRAC)
- **Audit Logger**: Maintains comprehensive audit trails

#### Human Interactions
- **Financial Controller**: Reviews high-value payments and complex scenarios
- **Compliance Officer**: Validates regulatory compliance and risk assessments
- **Operations Team**: Handles escalations and exception processing
- **Audit Team**: Reviews and validates payment processing logs
